The main goal is to remove unnecessary Samsung packages and privacy-invasive services from a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra while maintaining core phone functionality. We will use Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to safely remove packages at the user level without fully deleting them from the system. The phone is currently connected to this Windows computer and commands may be run to interact with the phone live. The goal of the program we will create is to list packages on the phone, find bloatware, and remove it via ADB. The primary program will reside in debloat_base.py.
